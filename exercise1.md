For our Node.js app, I’d use ESLint to keep our code clean, Vitest for testing, and Vite to bundle everything.

Instead of Jenkins or GitHub Actions, we could go with GitLab CI/CD. This option is straightforward and handle integration with our code repositories well.

Given we’re a team of six and our app is in active development, I’d lean towards a cloud-based CI tool. It’s simpler to set up and manage, and it scales as our needs grow. A self-hosted setup would give us more control, but it would also require more maintenance and resources, which might be more than we need right now. So, for ease and efficiency, a cloud-based solution seems like the better choice for us.
